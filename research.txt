    A tool that wraps groupby for better visualization of results in 2D.

    Creates buskets with labels that enrich a given dataset, and then perform

    Given a collection of trades from a backtest, we enrich it with 
    the underlying, the size, the time of day, triggering signal strength/std. 

    Then we can look at statistics of P&L of such trades with respect to
    underlying and time of day, to understand the liquidity.


    Parameters
    ----------------------
    x: array-like

    Attributes
    ----------------------
    n: int

    Triple Barrier Labeler in the sense of de Prado Chap 3.

    Given a price history defined by `level`, two horizontal barriers defined
    by `pl_unit`, `stop_factor`, and `limit_factor`, two vertical barriers
    defined by `signal` and `hold_period`, a long and hold strategy will be 
    carried out for potential entering times defined by `event_ts` according
    to the following rules:
    
    1. The next available price in `level` will be used as the entry for each `event_ts`
    2. If `signal` is not None, the next available price in `level` will be used as exit
    3. If `stop_factor`/`limit_factor` is not None, the strategy exit when touching it.
    4. If `hold_period` is not None, the strategy will exit when holding longer than that.
    
    The final label of the event will be dertermined by the earliest of the 4 or
    less cases whenever they are meaningful. In the output, a string label is
    used to denote the earliest event that triggeres the exit:

    V: hold period
    S: stopped
    L: limit
    B: signal

    If two or more events are triggered at the same time, the label will be taken
    from this ordering, so if S and B are both the earliest event, S will be shown.
